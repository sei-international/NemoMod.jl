Essentially, this means it seeks to meet energy and power demands over time at the lowest possible cost. The results of a NEMO model (the model's outputs) show the least-cost solution given the inputs you provided. Results can include which energy using and producing equipment is built, how and when the equipment is utilized, the level of demand and supply for different fuels, amounts of energy traded, energy system costs, pollutant emissions, and more. ","category":"page"},{"location":"modeling_concept/","page":"Modeling concept","title":"Modeling concept","text":"NEMO's cost minimization function operates on discounted costs (all costs are discounted to the beginning of the simulation). Minimized costs can include investment costs (capital and interest), fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs, and emission penalties for different components of the energy system (such as power plants, energy storage facilities, and transmission lines). When calculating a NEMO model, you can choose to optimize costs with perfect or limited foresight. If you use perfect foresight, the cost minimization simultaneously covers all modeled time periods, and NEMO finds the system configuration that gives the lowest possible discounted costs across all periods. Conversely, with limited foresight, you divide the modeled time periods into groups, and NEMO optimizes the groups in chronological order. In each group, NEMO minimizes the discounted costs for time periods within the group; results from the group then provide starting conditions for the next group.","category":"page"},{"location":"modeling_concept/","page":"Modeling concept","title":"Modeling concept","text":"NEMO is a deterministic modeling tool, but its robust performance makes it practical to explore uncertainties in inputs, including in a large scenario ensemble analysis framework. It represents an energy system through a series of input dimensions and parameters, calculated variables, constraints, and an objective function. A set of input dimensions and parameters (and optionally custom constraints) for NEMO constitutes a scenario. You define dimensions and parameters for a scenario by specifying them in a NEMO scenario database.

See NEMO's documentation on scenario databases   for details. Empty scenario databases can be generated with NEMO's createnemodb function.\njumpmodel::JuMP.Model: JuMP model object   specifying the solver to be used for the calculation. Examples:    Model(optimizer_with_attributes(GLPK.Optimizer, \"presolve\" => true)),   Model(CPLEX.Optimizer), Model(optimizer_with_attributes(Gurobi.Optimizer, \"NumericFocus\" => 1)),   direct_model(Gurobi.Optimizer()). Note that the solver's Julia package (Julia wrapper) must    be installed. See the documentation for JuMP for information on how to specify a solver and set    solver options.\ncalcyears::Union{Vector{Int}, Vector{Vector{Int}}}: Years to include in the calculation (should be a    subset of the years defined in the scenario database). If a single vector of years is provided, NEMO    calculates the scenario for those years with perfect foresight. If multiple vectors of years are    provided, NEMO performs a limited foresight calculation for the scenario: it calculates the first    group of years with perfect foresight, takes the results as the starting point for the second group    of years, calculates the second group with perfect foresight, and so on through the last group. In    this case, the vectors of years should not overlap and should be in chronological order.

If a vector of years is provided that does not intersect with the years in the   scenario database, it is ignored.\nvarstosave::String: Comma-delimited list of output variables whose results should be   saved in the scenario database when the scenario is calculated. See NEMO's documentation on   outputs for information on the variables that are available.\nrestrictvars::Bool: Indicates whether NEMO should conduct additional data analysis   to limit the set of variables created in the optimization problem for the scenario.   By default, to improve performance, NEMO selectively creates certain variables to   avoid combinations of subscripts that do not exist in the scenario's data. This option   increases the stringency of this filtering. It requires more processing time as the   problem is built, but it can substantially reduce the solve time for large models.\nreportzeros::Bool: Indicates whether results saved in the scenario database should   include values equal to zero. Specifying false can substantially improve the   performance of large models.\ncontinuoustransmission::Bool: Indicates whether continuous (true) or binary (false)   variables are used to represent investment decisions for candidate transmission lines. Not   relevant in scenarios that do not model transmission.\nforcemip::Bool: Forces NEMO to formulate the optimization problem for the scenario as a   mixed-integer problem. This can improve performance with some solvers (e.g., CPLEX, Mosek). If   this option is set to false, the input parameters for the scenario (i.e., in the scenario   database) determine whether the optimization problem is mixed-integer.\nstartvalsdbpath::String: Path to a previously calculated scenario database from which NEMO   should take starting values for variables in the optimization problem formulated in this   function. This argument is used in conjunction with startvalsvars.\nstartvalsvars::String: Comma-delimited list of variables for which starting values should be set.   See NEMO's documentation on outputs for information on the variables that are available. NEMO   takes starting values from output variable results saved in the database identified by   startvalsdbpath. Saved results are matched to variables in the optimization problem using   the variables' subscripts, and starting values are set with JuMP's set_start_value function.   If startvalsvars is an empty string, NEMO sets starting values for all variables present in   both the optimization problem and the startvalsdbpath database.\nprecalcresultspath::String: Path to a previously calculated scenario database that NEMO should   copy over the database specified by dbpath. This argument can also be a directory containing   previously calculated scenario databases, in which case NEMO copies any file in the directory   with the same name as the dbpath database. The intent of the argument is to short-circuit   calculations in situations where valid results already exist.\nwritefilename::String: Instructs NEMO to write the optimization problem for the scenario   to the specified file (without solving the problem). In limited foresight calculations, one   file is written for each group of years being optimized (an integer suffix is added to each   file's name to ensure uniqueness). If a path is not included in writefilename, the file(s)   is/are written to the Julia working directory. If writefilename ends in .gz or .bz2,    the file(s) is/are compressed with Gzip or BZip2, respectively. If both precalcresultspath   and writefilename are specified, writefilename is ignored.\nwritefileformat::MathOptInterface.FileFormats.FileFormat: Data format used for the file named   in writefilename. Common formats include MathOptInterface.FileFormats.FORMAT_MPS (MPS format) and   MathOptInterface.FileFormats.FORMAT_LP (LP format). See the documentation for   MathOptInterface for additional options.\ntraperrors::Bool: Indicates whether errors should be trapped and communicated with a standard    message that directs users to report the problem to the NEMO team.\nquiet::Bool: Suppresses low-priority status messages (which are otherwise printed to   STDOUT).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"calculatescenario/","page":"Julia syntax","title":"Julia syntax","text":"To access calculatescenario within Julia, you must first tell Julia you want to use NEMO.

The NEMO system image avoids this performance penalty by providing NEMO in a pre-compiled form. It is recommended for all users, especially those who are using NEMO with LEAP. Note, though, that if the NEMO system image is installed, any customizations you make to the NEMO code won't take affect unless you restore the default Julia system image.\nSelect the components to install, and press the Install button. Then follow the prompts to finish the installation (some steps may take a few minutes). The installer will tell you when the installation is complete.\n(Image: NEMO installer finished)","category":"page"},{"location":"installation/","page":"Installation","title":"Installation","text":"note: Note\nAt present, an installer is only available for Windows 10 and 11 64-bit.

Each modeled year is taken as the endpoint of an interval that starts after the prior modeled year (or at the beginning of the first year in the scenario database [the first scenario year], if there is no prior modeled year). For discounting purposes, investment costs incurred in a modeled year are assumed to be spread equally over the year's interval. NEMO's output variables for discounted technology and storage investment costs (vdiscountedcapitalinvestment and vdiscountedcapitalinvestmentstorage) reflect this adjustment.\nCalculates discounted transmission investment costs in the same way as discounted technology/storage investment costs if the continuoustransmission argument for calculatescenario is true. In this case, the output variable vdiscountedcapitalinvestmenttransmission includes the adjustment.\nEstimates discounted operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for technologies in non-modeled years. Fixed O&M costs are estimated by assuming that technology capacity evolves in a linear fashion between modeled years (or, if a modeled year's interval begins with the first scenario year, that there is a linear change from the residual capacity in that year to the capacity in the modeled year). Variable O&M costs are computed by assuming technology activity changes in a linear fashion between modeled years (or, if a modeled year's interval begins with the first scenario year, that the activity in the modeled year recurs in other years in the interval). Fixed and variable O&M costs are also assumed to remain constant between the last modeled year and the last year in the scenario database (the last scenario year). The output variable vdiscountedoperatingcost includes these adjustments.\nSimilarly estimates discounted transmission O&M costs in non-modeled years. For exogenously specified lines (where yconstruction is defined), fixed O&M costs in non-modeled years depend on whether the line exists in those years. For candidate lines NEMO may build endogenously (yconstruction is not provided), fixed O&M costs in non-modeled years are contingent on continuoustransmission. If this argument is true, fixed O&M costs are calculated by assuming that the fraction built of each line evolves linearly between modeled years (the fraction built at the start of the first scenario year is 0). If continuoustransmission is false, fixed O&M costs are counted in non-modeled years if a line has previously been built. In both cases, fixed O&M costs of candidate lines are assumed to remain constant between the last modeled year and the last scenario year. Variable O&M costs in non-modeled years are estimated by assuming transmission activity changes in a linear fashion between modeled years (or, if a modeled year's interval begins with the first scenario year, that the activity in the modeled year also holds in other years in the interval). Variable transmission O&M costs are presumed to remain constant between the last modeled year and the last scenario year.

Direct mode bypasses some JuMP features that help to ensure compatibility with a wide range of solvers. These include reformulating (or bridging) the constraints, variables, and optimization objective that NEMO defines as needed to promote cross-solver compatibility. When direct mode is invoked, scenario calculation is generally faster and requires less memory; however, it can result in a solver error in some cases. If this option is set in a configuration file, it overrides the selection of direct mode in the JuMP Model object passed to calculatescenario (via the jumpmodel argument). If jumpmodel does not align with jumpdirectmode, NEMO resets jumpmodel to activate/deactivate direct mode accordingly. This process restores model attributes (except for the choice of solver) and solver parameters to their default values. To ensure solver parameters are retained, specify them in the solver block of the configuration file. For more information on direct mode, see the JuMP documentation.\njumpbridges - Indicates whether JuMP's bridging features should be used in the calculation (ignored if jumpdirectmode is true, as this implies bridging is disabled). Bridging involves reformulating the constraints, variables, and optimization objective that NEMO defines as needed to promote cross-solver compatibility. When bridging is disabled, scenario calculation is generally faster and requires less memory; however, it can result in a solver error in some cases. If this option is set in a configuration file, it overrides the use of bridging in the JuMP Model object passed to calculatescenario (via the jumpmodel argument). If jumpmodel does not align with jumpbridges, NEMO resets jumpmodel to activate/deactivate bridging accordingly. This process has the same effects as described under jumpdirectmode. For more information on bridging, see the JuMP documentation.\ncalcyears - Years to include in the scenario calculation (should be a subset of the years defined in the scenario database; other years are ignored). As with the corresponding argument for calculatescenario, this option allows you to control whether NEMO performs perfect foresight or limited foresight optimization. The value you specify can include groups of years separated by commas; within each group, years should be separated by vertical bars (|). The years in any group can be sparse - i.e., you can calculate selected years only within a group. If you define more than one group, they should be in chronological order and should not overlap. When NEMO calculates the scenario, it takes the first group of years and optimizes it with perfect foresight, uses the results as the starting point for the next group of years (if there is one), optimizes the next group with perfect foresight, and so on through the last group. Example 1: 2025|2030|2035 = optimize 2025, 2030, and 2035 with perfect foresight. Example 2: 2025|2030,2035|2040 = optimize 2025 and 2030 with perfect foresight, then optimize 2035 and 2040 with perfect foresight (accounting for the results from 2025 and 2030). If this option is set in a configuration file, it overrides the calcyears argument for calculatescenario.\nvarstosave - Comma-delimited list of output variables (Julia variable names) whose values should be saved in the scenario database at the end of the calculation. NEMO adds variables specified in a configuration file to those requested in the varstosave argument for calculatescenario.\nrestrictvars - Indicates whether NEMO should conduct additional data analysis to limit the set of variables created in the optimization problem for the scenario (true or false). By default, to improve performance, NEMO selectively creates certain variables to avoid combinations of subscripts that do not exist in the scenario's data. This option increases the stringency of this filtering. It requires more processing time as the model is built, but it can substantially reduce the solve time for large models. If this option is specified in a configuration file, it overrides the restrictvars argument for calculatescenario.\nreportzeros - Indicates whether results saved in the scenario database should include values equal to zero (true or false). Forgoing zeros can substantially improve the performance of large models. If this option is specified in a configuration file, it overrides the reportzeros argument for calculatescenario.\ncontinuoustransmission - Indicates whether continuous (true) or binary (false) variables are used to represent investment decisions for candidate transmission lines. Continuous decision variables can decrease model run-time but may reduce the realism of transmission simulations. This option is not relevant in scenarios that do not model transmission. If it is specified in a configuration file, it overrides the continuoustransmission argument for calculatescenario.\nforcemip - Indicates whether NEMO is forced to formulate a mixed-integer optimization problem for the scenario (true or false). Activating this option can improve performance with some solvers (e.g., CPLEX, Mosek). If this option is specified in a configuration file, it overrides the forcemip argument for calculatescenario. If you do not activate forcemip (in a configuration file or as an argument for calculatescenario), the input parameters in your scenario database determine whether the optimization problem for the scenario is mixed-integer. See the note under Solver compatibility for more information.\nstartvalsdbpath - Path to a previously calculated scenario database from which NEMO should take starting values for optimization variables. Paths containing spaces should be enclosed in double quotes (\"). This option is used in conjunction with startvalsvars to warm start optimization. If it is specified in a configuration file, it overrides the startvalsdbpath argument for calculatescenario.\nstartvalsvars - Comma-delimited list of variables (Julia variable names) for which starting values should be set. NEMO takes starting values from output variable results saved in the database identified by startvalsdbpath. Saved results are matched to variables in the optimization problem using the variables' subscripts, and starting values are set with JuMP's set_start_value function. If you don't provide a value for startvalsvars, NEMO sets starting values for all variables present in both the optimization problem and the startvalsdbpath database. If startvalsvars is specified in a configuration file, it overrides the startvalsvars argument for calculatescenario.\nprecalcresultspath - Path to a previously calculated scenario database that NEMO should copy over the database specified by the calculatescenario dbpath argument. Paths containing spaces should be enclosed in double quotes (\"). This option can also be a directory containing previously calculated scenario databases, in which case NEMO copies any file in the directory with the same name as the dbpath database. If this option is activated, the copying replaces normal scenario optimization. If you set precalcresultspath in a configuration file, it overrides the precalcresultspath argument for calculatescenario.\nquiet - Indicates whether NEMO should suppress low-priority status messages (which are otherwise printed to STDOUT). If this option is specified in a configuration file, it overrides the quiet argument for calculatescenario.\nsolver block (solver options)\nparameters - Comma-delimited list of solver run-time parameters.

Most often, this is due to a long solve time (i.e., the solver takes a long time to find a solution), which in turn is driven by model complexity.","category":"page"},{"location":"performance_tips/","page":"Performance tips","title":"Performance tips","text":"If your model isn't calculating as quickly as you'd like, there are several steps to consider.","category":"page"},{"location":"performance_tips/","page":"Performance tips","title":"Performance tips","text":"Only save the output variables you need. Saving unnecessary variables increases disk operations and may result in a longer solve time (because additional constraints are needed to calculate the variables).\nDon't save zeros. If you set the reportzeros argument for calculatescenario to false (the default), NEMO won't save output variable values that are equal to zero. This can substantially reduce the time and disk space needed to write scenario outputs.\nCheck restrictvars. The restrictvars argument for calculatescenario can have an important effect on performance. This option tells NEMO to make a greater effort to eliminate unnecessary variables from the model it provides to the solver. This filtering process requires a little time, but it can considerably reduce the solver's work load. In general, the trade-off is advisable for large models (you should set restrictvars to true in these cases) but may not be for very small models (set restrictvars to false in these cases).\nUse parallel processing. NEMO can parallelize certain operations, reducing their run time by spreading the load across multiple processors. NEMO utilizes Julia's multi-threading system for parallelization, so parallel processing is activated whenever you run NEMO in a Julia session with multiple threads enabled. To start a Julia session with multiple threads, use the -t or --threads argument on the command line, or set the JULIA_NUM_THREADS operating system environment variable. If you install NEMO with the Windows installer program, the installer sets JULIA_NUM_THREADS to a reasonable default value. In general, NEMO performs best when it has 1-2 times as many threads as your computer has logical processors (however, certain models may benefit from more or fewer threads).\nNote that the number of Julia threads affects parallelization in NEMO's Julia code, but it doesn't control what happens with the solver. For maximum performance with large models, it's also helpful to use a solver that supports parallelization, such as CPLEX, Gurobi, or HiGHS.\nSimplify the scenario. Substantial performance gains can be realized by reducing the number of dimensions in a scenario - for example, decreasing the number of regions, technologies, time slices, years, or nodes. You can also speed up calculations by forgoing nodal transmission modeling. Of course, this approach generally requires trade-offs: a simpler model may not respond as well to the analytic questions you are asking. The goal is to find a reasonable balance between your model's realism and its performance.\nRelax the transmission simulation. If you're simulating transmission, there are some other performance tuning options to consider beyond reducing your model's dimensions. You can change the simulation method with the TransmissionModelingEnabled parameter or use this parameter to model transmission only in selected years. The calculatescenario function also has an argument (continuoustransmission) that determines whether NEMO uses binary or continuous variables to represent the construction of candidate transmission lines. With binary variables (continuoustransmission = false) candidate lines may only be built in their entirety, while with continuous variables (continuoustransmission = true) partial line construction is allowed. Continuous simulations are generally faster but may not be as realistic.\nUse CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit selectively. This parameter sets the minimum increment for endogenously determined capacity additions for a technology. When it's specified, NEMO uses integer variables to solve for capacity, which increases model solve time. If you don't define CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit, NEMO solves for technology capacity with continuous variables. This approach assumes that any increment of new capacity is permissible (subject to limits on minimum and maximum capacity and capacity investment - see TotalAnnualMinCapacity, TotalAnnualMaxCapacity, TotalAnnualMinCapacityInvestment, and TotalAnnualMaxCapacityInvestment).\nTry a different solver. The open-source solvers delivered with NEMO (Cbc, HiGHS, and GLPK) may struggle with sizeable models. If you have access to one of the commercial solvers NEMO supports (currently, CPLEX, Gurobi, Mosek, and Xpress), it will usually be a better option. If you're choosing from Cbc, HiGHS, and GLPK, test each of them to see which performs better for your scenario.\nConsider calculating selected years rather than all years. Calculating selected years in a scenario is a quick way to get results from complex models, but the results may differ from those you would get if you calculated all years. NEMO uses several methods to reduce the differences - see the documentation on calculating selected years for details.\nUse limited foresight instead of perfect foresight optimization. For many models, limited foresight calculations are faster than perfect foresight calculations. This is because NEMO divides the optimization problem into smaller, more tractable components when limited foresight is activated. Whether limited foresight is appropriate for your use case depends on several factors. See Perfect foresight vs. limited foresight for a discussion.\nTry disabling JuMP bridging or using JuMP's direct mode. By default, JuMP may reformulate the constraints, variables, and optimization objective that NEMO defines for a scenario to improve their compatibility with different solvers. This feature is called bridging. You can disable bridging in two ways: 1) by providing a JuMP.Model that does not use bridging to calculatescenario (via the jumpmodel argument); or 2) by setting jumpbridges to false in your NEMO configuration file. Deactivating bridging can reduce NEMO's memory use and decrease the solve time for large models, but it may also result in a solver error (depending on the solver you're using and the specifics of your NEMO scenario).\nIn the same vein, using JuMP in direct mode bypasses multiple features for cross-solver compatibility, including bridging. You can enable direct mode by supplying a JuMP.Model in direct mode to calculatescenario, or with the jumpdirectmode option in a NEMO configuration file. Direct mode generally reduces memory use and solve time, but it also carries a risk of a solver error. For both bridging and direct mode, a good practice is to test them with your model to see how they perform. For more information on both features, including how to activate/deactivate them when creating a JuMP.Model, see the JuMP documentation.","category":"page"},{"location":"time_slicing/","page":"Time slicing","title":"Time slicing","text":"CurrentModule = NemoMod","category":"page"},{"location":"time_slicing/#time_slicing","page":"Time slicing","title":"Time slicing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"time_slicing/","page":"Time slicing","title":"Time slicing","text":"NEMO provides a flexible mechanism for dividing years into sub-annual periods and modeling energy demand and supply in those periods.

In addition to streamlining operations that were already parallelized, this change allowed parallelization of constraint creation and results saving in calculatescenario. It should reduce run-time and memory use for most models. Deprecated the numprocs and targetprocs arguments for calculatescenario and writescenariomodel; they were used to select distributed Julia processes and are no longer needed. When parallel processing, NEMO uses as many threads as are available in the Julia session. This in turn is controlled by a command line argument or environment variable provided when invoking Julia (see Julia's documentation for details).\nImproved functionality for renewable energy targets: Increased the flexibility and simplicity of NEMO's renewable energy target calculations. Added fuel as a dimension for REMinProductionTarget, so this parameter now describes the fraction of a fuel's production in a region and year that must be by renewable technologies. As in earlier versions of NEMO, the RETagTechnology parameter determines the renewability of technologies. Modified the logic for verifying compliance with REMinProductionTarget to exclude production from storage. Removed the RETagFuel parameter and vtotalreproductionannual and vretotalproductionoftargetfuelannual output variables since the new calculation method made them superfluous.\nVariables for generation and renewable generation: Added output variables for annual generation (i.e., production excluding production from storage) and annual generation from renewable technologies. See vgenerationannualnn, vgenerationannualnodal, vregenerationannualnn, and vregenerationannualnodal.\nMinimum production share: Added MinShareProduction, a parameter that specifies a technology's minimum share of production of a fuel in a given region and year (excluding production from storage).\nWarm starts: Added two arguments to calculatescenario and writescenariomodel to enable warm starting optimization. NEMO's approach to warm starting is to take starting values for model output (decision) variables from a previously calculated scenario database. You specify the path to the previously calculated database with the startvalsdbpath argument; and you can optionally control which variables get starting values with the startvalsvars argument. These arguments can be provided either on the command line or through a NEMO configuration file. See the documentation for calculatescenario for more details.\nBypassing optimization when results have already been calculated: Added an argument to calculatescenario, precalcresultspath, that allows you to identify a previously calculated scenario database that should be used in lieu of optimizing the main scenario database passed to the function (i.e., the database named in the dbpath argument). If you specify a previously calculated database with precalcresultspath, NEMO copies it over the database at dbpath. This feature is intended for users who are calling NEMO through LEAP and want to compile results from multiple scenarios (which may have been calculated on different machines) in one LEAP area. You can use precalcresultspath either on the command line or through a NEMO configuration file. See the documentation for calculatescenario for more details.\nBug fix - transmission line efficiency: Corrected an error in how NEMO calculates transmission energy losses and variable costs when the transmission modeling type is 3 (pipeline flow; see TransmissionModelingEnabled) and line efficiency is less than 1. The calculations now properly account for bidirectional flow through lines. As part of this fix, removed the vtransmissionbylineannual output variable and added two variables for transmission variable costs: vvariablecosttransmission and vvariablecosttransmissionbyts.\nWindows installer enhancements for multi-user environments: Revised the NEMO Windows installer program to facilitate installations in multi-user environments (i.e., when the installer is run by one Windows user, but NEMO will be run by different Windows users). Among other changes, the new installer program installs Julia for all users. As usual, it is not necessary to uninstall older versions of NEMO before running the installer.\nOther improvements: Revised NEMO's documentation to note that nodal storage modeling requires transmission modeling to be enabled for a storage's input and output fuels. See NodalDistributionStorageCapacity.","category":"page"},{"location":"release_notes/#Version-1.6","page":"Release notes","title":"Version 1.6","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"release_notes/","page":"Release notes","title":"Release notes","text":"Interest rates for technologies, storage, and transmission lines: Added parameters for interest rates for technologies (InterestRateTechnology), storage (InterestRateStorage), and transmission lines (interestrate property of TransmissionLine). If you specify an interest rate, NEMO uses it to calculate financing costs for new endogenous capacity, assuming the capital costs are financed at the interest rate and repaid in equal installments over the life of the capacity. The financing costs are reported in three new output variables (vfinancecost, vfinancecoststorage, and vfinancecosttransmission) and enter into NEMO's cost minimization objective. They are also considered when calculating salvage values for technologies, storage, and transmission lines.\nNegative emissions: Revised NEMO to accommodate negative emissions from technologies. You can activate this feature by specifying a negative emission factor (EmissionActivityRatio). If a technology has a negative emission factor for a pollutant with an externality cost (EmissionsPenalty), it can generate negative emission penalties (vannualtechnologyemissionspenalty / vannualtechnologyemissionpenaltybyemission), lowering total system costs. In this case, you may need to constrain the technology's operation to avoid an unbounded (infeasible) optimization problem. For example, if a technology can generate negative emissions of a pollutant with an externality cost, the cost of building and running the technology is lower than the externality value, and there are no limits on the technology's deployment and use, the optimization problem will be unbounded.\nDeprecation of technology, storage, and transmission-specific discount rates: Based on discussions with users, retired this functionality that was introduced in NEMO 1.5.\nOther performance improvements: Improved the robustness of the createnemodb function.","category":"page"},{"location":"release_notes/#Version-1.5","page":"Release notes","title":"Version 1.5","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"release_notes/","page":"Release notes","title":"Release notes","text":"Technology, storage, and transmission-specific discount rates: Revised NEMO so users can specify a different discount rate for each technology and region, storage and region, and transmission line.

You can invoke this feature with a new calcyears argument for calculatescenario (and writescenariomodel). Calculating selected years can quickly provide results for large models. The results may not be identical to what you would get if you calculated all years, but NEMO uses several methods to reduce discrepancies between the two cases. See Calculating selected years for details.\nNew default solver - Cbc: Changed the default solver for calculatescenario to Cbc. Since NEMO version 1.3, Cbc generally offers better performance than GLPK for NEMO models.\nSimplified parameters for inter-regional trading: Trading between two regions can now be enabled with a single row linking the regions in TradeRoute.\nNew output variable - vtransmissionbylineannual: Added a variable that reports annual transmission through a transmission line in energy terms.\nBug fix - exogenous emissions: Revised vannualemissions so it includes any exogenously specified annual emissions (AnnualExogenousEmission), and vmodelperiodemissions so it includes any exogenously specified annual and model period emissions (AnnualExogenousEmission and ModelPeriodExogenousEmission).\nOther performance improvements: Implemented various enhancements to improve NEMO's performance for large models, particularly those with multiple regions.","category":"page"},{"location":"release_notes/#Version-1.3.1","page":"Release notes","title":"Version 1.3.1","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"release_notes/","page":"Release notes","title":"Release notes","text":"Solver parameters in NEMO configuration files: Added support for setting solver parameters via a NEMO configuration file.

You can use this information to determine how to modify the model's inputs to avoid infeasibility.","category":"page"},{"location":"infeasibility/","page":"Troubleshooting infeasibility","title":"Troubleshooting infeasibility","text":"If you're starting with a NEMO scenario database, you can apply find_infeasibilities as follows:","category":"page"},{"location":"infeasibility/","page":"Troubleshooting infeasibility","title":"Troubleshooting infeasibility","text":"Create a JuMP model\nCall calculatescenario for the scenario database, passing it the JuMP model in the jumpmodel argument\nCall find_infeasibilities for the JuMP model","category":"page"},{"location":"infeasibility/","page":"Troubleshooting infeasibility","title":"Troubleshooting infeasibility","text":"Here's an example:","category":"page"},{"location":"infeasibility/","page":"Troubleshooting infeasibility","title":"Troubleshooting infeasibility","text":"julia> using NemoMod, JuMP, HiGHS\n\njulia> m = direct_model(HiGHS.Optimizer())\nA JuMP Model\nFeasibility problem with:\nVariables: 0\nModel mode: DIRECT\nSolver name: HiGHS\n\njulia> NemoMod.calculatescenario(\"c:/temp/storage_test_infeasible.sqlite\"; jumpmodel=m)\n2025-17-Feb 17:38:27.023 Started modeling scenario.

If you don't provide a value for calcyears, NEMO optimizes all years in the scenario database with perfect foresight.","category":"page"},{"location":"foresight/","page":"Perfect foresight vs. limited foresight","title":"Perfect foresight vs. limited foresight","text":"Here are a few examples, assuming you have a scenario whose years cover 2025 to 2050.","category":"page"},{"location":"foresight/","page":"Perfect foresight vs. limited foresight","title":"Perfect foresight vs. limited foresight","text":"# Optimize all years with perfect foresight\nNemoMod.calculatescenario(\"my_scenario.sqlite\"; jumpmodel=direct_model(Xpress.Optimizer()), \n    calcyears=[[2025,2026,2027,2028,2029,2030,2031,2032,2033,2034,2035,2036,2037,2038,2039,2040,2041,2042,2043,2044,2045,2046,2047,2048,2049,2050]])\n\n# Optimize all years with perfect foresight (calcyears argument omitted)\nNemoMod.calculatescenario(\"my_scenario.sqlite\"; jumpmodel=direct_model(Xpress.Optimizer()))\n\n# Optimize selected years with perfect foresight\nNemoMod.calculatescenario(\"my_scenario.sqlite\"; jumpmodel=direct_model(Xpress.Optimizer()), \n    calcyears=[[2025,2030,2035,2040,2045,2050]])\n\n# Limited foresight optimization in three parts:\n#   optimize 2025-2034 with perfect foresight, \n#   then optimize 2035-2044 with perfect foresight,\n#   then optimize 2045-2050 with perfect foresight\nNemoMod.calculatescenario(\"my_scenario.sqlite\"; jumpmodel=direct_model(Xpress.Optimizer()), \n    calcyears=[[2025,2026,2027,2028,2029,2030,2031,2032,2033,2034], \n    [2035,2036,2037,2038,2039,2040,2041,2042,2043,2044], \n    [2045,2046,2047,2048,2049,2050]])  \n\n# Limited foresight optimization in three parts (calculating selected years only): \n#   optimize 2025, 2030, and 2034 with perfect foresight; \n#   then optimize 2035, 2040, and 2044 with perfect foresight; \n#   then optimize 2045 and 2050 with perfect foresight\nNemoMod.calculatescenario(\"my_scenario.sqlite\"; jumpmodel=direct_model(Xpress.Optimizer()), \n    calcyears=[[2025,2030,2034], [2035,2040,2044], [2045,2050]])  \n\n# Limited foresight optimization: optimize each year individually\nNemoMod.calculatescenario(\"my_scenario.sqlite\"; jumpmodel=direct_model(Xpress.Optimizer()), \n    calcyears=[[2025],[2026],[2027],[2028],[2029],[2030],[2031],[2032],[2033],[2034],[2035],[2036],[2037],[2038],[2039],[2040],[2041],[2042],[2043],[2044],[2045],[2046],[2047],[2048],[2049],[2050]])","category":"page"},{"location":"foresight/","page":"Perfect foresight vs. limited foresight","title":"Perfect foresight vs. limited foresight","text":"You can also specify calcyears in a NEMO configuration file.
