# [Variables](@id variables)

Variables are the outputs from calculating a scenario. They show the decisions taken to solve the optimization problem. When you calculate a scenario, you can choose which variables to output (see the `varstosave` argument of [`calculatescenario`](@ref)). NEMO will then save the selected variables in the [scenario database](@ref scenario_db). Each saved variable gets its own table with columns for its [dimensions](@ref dimensions) (labeled with NEMO's standard abbreviations - e.g., `r` for [region](@ref region)), a value column (`val`), and a column indicating the date and time the scenario was solved (`solvedtm`).

## [Nodal vs. non-nodal variables](@id nodal_def)

Many NEMO outputs have "nodal" and "non-nodal" variants. **Nodal** variables show results for regions, [fuels](@ref fuel), [technologies](@ref technology), [storage](@ref storage), and [years](@ref year) involved in transmission modeling - i.e., for cases where capacity, demand, and supply are simulated in a nodal network. To enable transmission modeling, you must define several dimensions and [parameters](@ref parameters): [nodes](@ref node), [transmission lines](@ref transmissionline), [TransmissionModelingEnabled](@ref TransmissionModelingEnabled), [TransmissionCapacityToActivityUnit](@ref TransmissionCapacityToActivityUnit), [NodalDistributionDemand](@ref NodalDistributionDemand), [NodalDistributionStorageCapacity](@ref NodalDistributionStorageCapacity), and [NodalDistributionTechnologyCapacity](@ref NodalDistributionTechnologyCapacity). **Non-nodal** variables show results for cases where transmission modeling is not enabled.

!!! note
    Non-nodal variables for energy use can include use of transmission-enabled fuels by technologies that are not involved in transmission modeling - i.e., technologies that are not assigned to nodes in `NodalDistributionTechnologyCapacity`. See the variable descriptions below for more details. Technologies that are not involved in transmission modeling are not allowed to produce transmission-enabled fuels.
