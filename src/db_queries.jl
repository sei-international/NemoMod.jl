    scenario_calc_queries(dbpath::String, transmissionmodeling::Bool, vproductionbytechnologysaved::Bool,
        vusebytechnologysaved::Bool, restrictyears::Bool, inyears::String)

Returns a `Dict` of query commands used in NEMO's `modelscenario` function. Each key in the return value is
    a query name, and each value is a `Tuple` where:
        - Element 1 = path to NEMO scenario database in which to execute query (taken from `dbpath` argument)
        - Element 2 = query's SQL statement
    The function's arguments other than `dbpath` delimit the set of returned query commands as noted below.

# Arguments
- `dbpath::String`: Path to NEMO scenario database in which query commands should be executed.
- `transmissionmodeling::Bool`: Indicates whether transmission modeling is enabled in `modelscenario`.
    Additional query commands are included in results when transmission modeling is enabled.
- `vproductionbytechnologysaved::Bool`: Indicates whether output variable `vproductionbytechnology`
    will be saved in `modelscenario`. Additional query commands are included in results when this argument
    and `transmissionmodeling` are `true`.
- `vusebytechnologysaved::Bool`: Indicates whether output variable `vusebytechnology`
    will be saved in `modelscenario`. Additional query commands are included in results when this argument
    and `transmissionmodeling` are `true`.
- `restrictyears::Bool`: Indicates whether `modelscenario` is running for selected years only.
- `inyears::String`: SQL IN clause predicate for years selected for `modelscenario`. When `restrictvars`
    is `true`, this argument is used to include filtering by year in query commands.
- `limitedforesight::Bool`: Indicates whether `modelscenario` is executing part of a limited foresight optimization.
- `lastyearprevgroupyears`: If `modelscenario` is executing part of a limited foresight optimization, the last year 
    modeled in the previous step of the optimization (i.e., the previous invocation of `modelscenario`). `nothing`
    if the current step is the first step of the optimization. Additional query commands are included in results 
    when `limitedforesight` is `true` and this argument is not `nothing`.
- `firstmodeledyear::String`: The first year being modeled in the current invocation of `modelscenario`. Only used
    `limitedforesight` is `true` and `lastyearprevgroupyears` is not `nothing`."""
